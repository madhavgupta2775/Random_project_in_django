okay, this is the second try at a readme (accidentally obliterated the first readme while trying to merge branches).

# Random_project_in_django

This is a random project in django which I ~~have~~ had started on a whim. It's main purpose is to help me have a better understanding of how stuff works or well, it was, though currently I work on this because I really love it and it's fun. Since the features are pretty random, hence it has a random name.


These are the main features currenly in development:

### Group Chat/DM

This might take a while. Currently learning DRF for implementing this.

### have a net activity chart

~~I spend a lot more time on competitive programming than on projects like this. Hence, my github looks shit and has a almost white activity chart.~~
I decided to make a net activity chart which combines the activity of websites like codeforces and github. Basically it's purpose is that I can look at a greener activity chart to feel good about myself.

upd: I am a bit confused as to whether I should add this or not, hence it is on hold for now.

### easter eggs

Just for fun :)

This may change with time (like how it got completely erased once), and hopefully it will get better.
