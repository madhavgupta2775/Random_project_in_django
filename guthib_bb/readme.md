okay, this is the second try at a readme (accidentally obliterated the first readme while trying to merge branches).

# Random_project_in_django

This is a random project in django which I have started on a whim. It's main purpose is to help me have a better understanding of how stuff works and make my life a little less miserable. Since the features are pretty random, hence it has a random name.

These are the main features it is supposed to have:

### -> have a net activity chart

I spend a lot more time on competitive programming than on projects like this. Hence, my github looks shit and has a almost white activity chart.
So I decided to make a net activity chart which combines the activity of websites like codeforces and github. Basically it's purpose is that I can look at a greener activity chart to feel good about myself.

### -> have memos for various stuff

A lot of times, I decide a new task for myself but forget about it pretty quickly (like learning rust so that I can become a femboy). Also, it can also be used to write plans for side projects and stuff. 

### -> Google login and profile

No specific reason for this, just thought of including this so that I can get a better grasp of how this is implemented.

### -> easter eggs

Just for fun :)

This may change with time (like how it got completely erased once), and hopefully it will get better.
